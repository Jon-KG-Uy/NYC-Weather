# NYC-Weather
W.I.P. visualization of NYC weather for Data Visualization class

Main file is: sketch.js

Currently working on this code in the p5.js Web Editor.

Visualization takes input from OpenWeatherAPI, set location for testing purposes is NYC.
Visualization currently handles: 
 - Clear/Sunny, Rainy, and Cloudy weather
 - Current Temperature
 - Current Date and Time
 
Visualization will (soon) include:
 - animated looping visuals for rain and clouds
 - mapped 'sun' function to emulate the current time of day
   - will feature changing background color and sun movement
 - better visualization of NYC skyline
